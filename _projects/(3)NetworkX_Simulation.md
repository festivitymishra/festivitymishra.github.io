### Organization Hierarchy Simulation

![preview](https://github.com/festivitymishra/festivitymishra.github.io/blob/master/_projects/figures/Sim2.gif?raw=true)

#### Business Problem : 
As organizations design large teams for growth, it is required to have an oversight on scale and network for reducing operation cost and increasing productivity. 

#### Solution :
* <b> Simulation of growth of an organization</b> with different strategies using <b>NetworkX</b> in python.
* Designed an <b>agent based simulation with Pysim</b> to access the cost of operation within various cases using tree traversal techniques.
* Optimized organization hierarchy to <b>reduce operations cost and increased productivity</b> with different growth & compensation strategies using DI graph NetworkX and PySim.
