### MORL for Personalised Offer Recommendations

#### Research Overview

This work extends Target's Contextual Offer Recommendation Engine (CORE) to a **multi-objective framework**, highlighting how bandit frameworks utilize advanced machine learning techniques to optimize for both guest engagement and incremental sales.

#### Key Research Contributions

**1. Multi-Objective Optimization Framework**
- Integrated multi-objective reinforcement learning with contextual bandits
- Simultaneous optimization of engagement (opt-in rate) and incremental sales
- Addresses real-world challenge of balancing multiple business objectives

**2. Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF) Integration**
- Tackles sparsity in guest-coupon interaction matrix
- Factorizes interaction matrix V into guest matrix (W) and offer matrix (H)
- Leverages offer latent features as per-arm features in contextual bandit approach
- Reconstructs dense approximation matrix for more effective recommendations

**3. Hypervolume Scalarization**
- Implements nonlinear scalarization method for multi-objective optimization
- Enables exploration of both convex and non-convex regions of Pareto frontier
- Provides theoretical guarantees for convergence to Pareto optimal solutions
- Based on research by Golovin et al. (2020) on Random Hypervolume Scalarizations

**4. Neural Epsilon-Greedy Agent**
- Enhanced epsilon-greedy strategy with neural network integration
- Balances exploration (ε) and exploitation (1-ε) in multi-objective setting
- Custom-built RL environment simulating guest-offer interactions

#### Technical Methodology

**Objective Functions:**
- **Engagement Metric**: Opt-in rate indicator for guest-offer interactions
- **Incremental Sales**: Revenue impact measured as percentage change in sales

**Matrix Factorization:**
- Original sparse interaction matrix V → factorized into W (guest features) and H (offer features)
- Dense approximation matrix I' reconstructed for improved recommendations

**Hypervolume Scalarization:**
- Random weight vector sampling from positive orthant
- Scalarized reward: R_t(a) = ⟨w, r_t(a)⟩
- Action selection: a_t = arg max_{a∈A} R_t(a)

#### Research Impact

- **Industry Application**: Production system serving 100M+ Target Circle members
- **Theoretical Contribution**: Application of hypervolume scalarization to contextual bandits
- **Practical Innovation**: First large-scale MORL system for personalized offers
