description: Share to Secure Application for Blockchain Enabled Insurance on Azure Blockchain Workbench.

Insurance systems need a reform. First, we need to digitize and securely share claims data and other associated data (health records for health insurance, automobile records for auto insurance, etc.) across stakeholders. Second, we need to codify business rules and automate claims processing, such that payments are automatically and quickly transferred when claims are verified.
