description: Fast Route Planning & Route Optimisation with the help of travelling salesman problem (TSP) algorithm - Given a set of deliveries to be made in particular time duration, the TSP Algorithm computes the fastest and shortest route for the given fleet of vehicles. The solver relies on OpenStreetMap data and does matrix calculations by triggering Open-Source Routing Machine (OSRM), thus making the route locality-aware.
