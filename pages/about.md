## **About Me**

I'm a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer based in Bengaluru, India. I work with an amazing team, surrounded by great people, and I'm passionate about machine learning and its real-world applications. I have extensive experience in solving complex business problems across various domains using machine learning to build applications and enable products.

When I'm not coding or building models, I enjoy going on long walks, treks, exploring new places, and listening to music.

## **Background**

I completed my bachelor's degree at [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/). During my academic years, I spent the majority of my time engaging in coursework, hackathons, and extracurricular activities that bridge the gap between quantitative and qualitative learning. I'm always looking to work in fields that utilize the programming, critical thinking, and research skills I've gained during my college years and professional experience.

## **Research Interests**

My research interests include machine learning, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. I'm particularly interested in research that explores how reinforcement learning algorithms, coupled with the predictive power of deep neural networks, can be used to create innovative applications in operations research, computational biology, conversational intelligence, and computer vision.

My most rewarding experiences have involved applying data science principles to solve business cases, which has shaped my career path. See the [Projects](https://festivitymishra.github.io/projects/) section of this site for examples of my work!
