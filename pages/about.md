# About Utsav Mishra - Staff ML Engineer & Principal Data Scientist

## **About Me**

I'm a **Staff ML Engineer** with 8+ years of experience architecting and scaling ML, RL, and GenAI systems that drive enterprise impact across retail and fintech. I have a proven track record of translating cutting-edge ML research into high-revenue production systems for 100M+ users, with deep expertise in multi-armed bandits, RAG-based retrieval systems, deep learning architectures, and real-time decision systems.

I'm recognized for patented innovations, technical thought leadership, and establishing organization-wide ML frameworks and best practices. My work combines research excellence with business impact, consistently delivering measurable results at scale.

When I'm not architecting ML systems or mentoring teams, I enjoy going on long walks, treks, exploring new places, and listening to music.

## **Professional Focus**

**Technical Leadership & Architecture:** I architect ML strategies and technical roadmaps for large-scale platforms, define experimentation frameworks, model architectures, and scaling patterns. I drive technical architecture decisions across cross-functional teams, establishing best practices for model design, MLOps pipelines, and ML integration.

**Research-to-Production Translation:** I specialize in taking cutting-edge ML research and translating it into production systems that drive measurable business impact. My patented Contextual Offer Recommendation Engine (CORE) achieved **+70% redemption uplift** and **+28% opt-in uplift**, contributing **>$500M in incremental sales**.

**Team Leadership & Mentorship:** I mentor and grow data science teams, coaching on advanced ML techniques and research-to-production translation. I've successfully mentored team members who received promotions and established reusable ML frameworks that drive organizational technical maturity.

## **Key Expertise**

- **Reinforcement Learning:** Multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, DDQN, exploration-exploitation strategies
- **Generative AI:** RAG-based retrieval systems, LLM integration, automated ML workflows
- **Deep Learning:** LSTM, CNN, neural architectures, transfer learning
- **ML Infrastructure:** GCP, VertexAI, Kubeflow, PySpark, TensorFlow, MLOps pipelines
- **Causal ML & Experimentation:** A/B testing frameworks, causal inference, statistical validation

## **Education**

I completed my bachelor's degree in Architecture at [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/). My coursework included Programming & Data Structures, Probability Mathematics, Image Processing & Remote Sensing, and Economics. During my academic years, I engaged in hackathons and projects that applied quantitative methods to real-world problems, winning multiple hackathons including Microsoft Azure Hackathon (1st Runner's Up) and MishMash Hackathon (1st Runner's Up).

See the [Projects](https://festivitymishra.github.io/projects/) section for detailed examples of my work!
