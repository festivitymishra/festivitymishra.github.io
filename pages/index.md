## **About Me**

I'm a **Staff ML Engineer** with 8+ years of experience architecting and scaling ML, RL, and GenAI systems that drive enterprise impact across retail and fintech. I specialize in translating cutting-edge ML research into high-revenue production systems for 100M+ users, with expertise in multi-armed bandits, RAG-based retrieval systems, deep learning architectures, and real-time decision systems.

Currently, I lead data science initiatives at **Target Corporation** as a **Lead Data Scientist L6**, where I architect ML strategies, mentor teams of 16+ data scientists and engineers, and drive technical decisions for systems serving 100M+ users. My work has generated **>$500M in incremental sales** through patented innovations in reinforcement learning and recommendation systems.

I'm recognized for technical thought leadership, establishing organization-wide ML frameworks, and building production-grade systems that combine research excellence with business impact. My expertise spans GenAI/RAG systems, contextual bandits, causal ML, and scaling ML infrastructure on cloud platforms.
