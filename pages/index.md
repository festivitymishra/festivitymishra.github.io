# About Utsav Mishra - Staff ML Engineer | Principal Data Scientist | AI Engineer

## **About Me**

I'm a **Staff ML Engineer** and **Principal Data Scientist** with 8+ years of experience architecting and scaling ML, RL, and GenAI systems that drive enterprise impact across retail and fintech. As an **AI Engineer** and **ML Scientist**, I specialize in translating cutting-edge ML research into high-revenue production systems for 100M+ users, with expertise in multi-armed bandits, RAG-based retrieval systems, deep learning architectures, and real-time decision systems.

Currently, I lead data science initiatives at **Target Corporation** as a **Lead Data Scientist L6**, where I architect ML strategies, mentor teams of 16+ data scientists and engineers, and drive technical decisions for systems serving 100M+ users. My work has generated **>$500M in incremental sales** through patented innovations in reinforcement learning and recommendation systems.

I'm recognized for technical thought leadership, establishing organization-wide ML frameworks, and building production-grade systems that combine research excellence with business impact. My expertise spans GenAI/RAG systems, contextual bandits, causal ML, and scaling ML infrastructure on cloud platforms.

## **Key Expertise Areas**

- **Reinforcement Learning & Multi-Arm Bandits**: Expert in contextual bandits, DDQN, and exploration-exploitation strategies for recommendation systems
- **Generative AI & RAG Systems**: Built production RAG systems for automated forecasting and intelligent retrieval
- **Deep Learning**: Specialized in LSTM, CNN, neural architectures for time-series forecasting and computer vision
- **MLOps & Cloud Infrastructure**: Architecting scalable ML pipelines on GCP, AWS using Kubeflow, Spark, TensorFlow
- **Causal ML & Experimentation**: Designing robust A/B testing frameworks and causal inference methods

## **Notable Achievements**
