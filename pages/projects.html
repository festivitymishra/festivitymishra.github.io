## **Reinforcement Learning Projects**

My work in reinforcement learning spans from insurance underwriting automation to large-scale personalized recommendation systems. These projects demonstrate the application of RL techniques including Deep Q-Networks (DDQN), Multi-Objective RL, and Contextual Bandits to solve real-world business problems.
