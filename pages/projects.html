<h1>Machine Learning & AI Projects</h1>
<p>
Below you can find some of the projects I've done during my work and studies. These projects demonstrate expertise in <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>, <strong>Generative AI</strong>, <strong>Multi-Arm Bandits</strong>, and <strong>Deep Learning</strong>. Opening any of these will take you either to a project report or a GitHub repository.
