- title: Lead Data Scientist L6 (Promoted), Target Corporation
  from: October 2021
  description: >
              • Architected and owned the ML strategy and technical roadmap for Target's offer personalization platform (100M+ users), defining experimentation frameworks, model architectures, and scaling patterns for multi-market deployment. <br>
              • Drove technical architecture decisions across a team of 16 data scientists and engineers, establishing best practices for model design, MLOps pipelines, and cross-team ML integration. <br>
              • Mentored and grew 5 data science team members, coaching on advanced ML techniques and research-to-production translation; two received promotions. <br>
              • Invented & patented Target's Contextual Offer Recommendation Engine (CORE), an RL-based contextual bandit framework. Architected the system from research to production, driving +70% redemption and +28% opt-in uplift (stat-sig), contributing over $500M incremental sales. <br>
              • Architected and implemented TargetRun - Guest-Level Trip Forecasting with LSTM. Achieved statistically significant improvements: reduced MAPE and MAE by ~50% and drove measurable lifts in campaign opt-in, completion, and redemption rates across all engagement segments. <br>
              • Architected and built Lookalike, a GenAI-powered RAG system that automates campaign forecasting through intelligent retrieval and ranking. Achieved 100% coverage (K=3 recommendations), eliminating manual campaign triage and reducing setup time by 1.5 days per campaign. <br>
              • Architected automated ML data and training pipelines on GCP using Spark, Kubeflow, and Oozie with TensorFlow Agents; established standardized model tracking and monitoring through TensorBoard and Grafana. <br>
              • Technical thought leadership: Presented advanced ML methodologies at company-wide technical forums and received VP Award for Innovation & Impact. <br>
              
- title: Applied Data Scientist 2, Tata AIA Life
  from: April 2020
  to: October 2021
  description:  
              • Applied NLP techniques including Gensim LDA topic modeling to identify drop-off points in customer onboarding, achieving 6.2% conversion rate increase. Developed interactive journey visualizations using Plotly Sankey diagrams. <br>
              • Developed a GBM regression profit prediction model (R² = 0.991) and deployed it in production via FastAPI; reduced valuation TAT by 30 days. Implemented SHAP for feature attribution and built Streamlit visualization for explainable AI. <br>
                
- title: Machine Learning Engineer, HDFC Life
  from: January 2018
  to: March 2020
  description: 
              • Developed a Face Recognition system with Anti-Spoofing capabilities using CNN and DeepFace embeddings to reduce fraud in virtual customer onboarding. Deployed as a containerized service using Docker and ECS. <br>
              • Designed and developed the serverless architecture of Lead allocation and Route optimisation app on AWS Data Lake (Lambda, DMS, Dynamodb, Step Function, S3, API Gateway, and Docker). <br>
              • Built a cost-sensitive Medical Risk classification model using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDQN), achieving >91% accuracy while intelligently balancing diagnostic test costs. <br>
