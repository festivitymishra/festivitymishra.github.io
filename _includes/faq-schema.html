        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties. It's used in recommendation systems, game playing, robotics, and personalized systems. Common RL techniques include multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and deep Q-networks (DQN)."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Generative AI (GenAI) refers to AI systems that can generate new content. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines information retrieval with language models to provide accurate, context-aware responses. RAG systems are used in chatbots, search systems, and automated workflows."

      "name": "What are Multi-Arm Bandits?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Multi-Arm Bandits are a class of reinforcement learning algorithms that balance exploration (trying new options) and exploitation (using known best options). They're widely used in recommendation systems, A/B testing, and personalized systems to optimize user engagement and business metrics."
